    "We want to make a regression for energy demand in germany. This task can be achieved by using gradient boosting models. They have some advantages and disadvantages (taken from [neptune.ai](https://neptune.ai/blog/gradient-boosted-decision-trees-guide))\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Advantages of gradient boosting trees\n",
    ">- generally more accurate compare to other modes,\n",
    ">- train faster especially on larger datasets,\n",
    ">- most of them provide support handling categorical features,\n",
    ">- some of them handle missing values natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### Disadvantages of gradient boosting trees\n",
    ">- prone to overfitting: this can be solved by applying L1 and L2 regularization penalties. You can try a low learning rate as well;\n",
    ">- models can be computationally expensive and take a long time to train, especially on CPUs;\n",
    "hard to interpret the final models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In gradient boosting, an ensemble of weak learners (usually, decision trees) is used to improve the performance of a machine learning model. Their combined output results in better models. \n",
    "Weak learners work sequentially: Each model tries to improve on the error from the previous model. In the case of regression, the result is the average of all weak learners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, with gradient boosting models we can make a regression on energy demand and as they are described as fast training on large datasets with very good results."
