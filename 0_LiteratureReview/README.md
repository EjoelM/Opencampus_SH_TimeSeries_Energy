**Summary of Each Work**:

- **Source 1**: Short-term office building elevator energy consumption forecast using SARIMA

  - **[Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19401493.2019.1698657)**
  - **Objective**:Forecast of energy consumption of a green-elevator
  - **Methods**: Use of three variations of SARIMA model (daily, hourly and 15-min data)  
  - **Outcomes**: The model with the highest accruacy (measured mainly with the MAPE indicator) was the SARIMA model using hourly data. 
  - **Relation to the Project**: Energy consumption is the main focus of our project. Furthermore, we wanted evaluate which SARIMA model could be the "best" baseline model. Other literatures also indicate that the 1h SARIMA model is the most used SARIMA model when it comes to forecasting energy consumption.
